## Project description

The project aims to import four hospital datasets into SQL databases and one hotel review dataset into Firebase. A web interface will be developed for users to select the desired dataset, search based on user preferences, and explore with primary and foreign key relations.

## Datasets
The following datasets are provided by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and are accessible via Socrata Open Data API (SODA).

1. [Complications and Deaths - Hospital](https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Complications-and-Deaths-Hospital/ynj2-r877) (23MB) - includes scoring and national comparison of complications and deaths of U.S. hospitals.
2. [Timely and Effective Care - Hospital](https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Timely-and-Effective-Care-Hospital/yv7e-xc69) (21MB) - includes scoring of care in various departments of U.S. hospitals.
3. [Healthcare Associated Infections - Hospital](https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Healthcare-Associated-Infections-Hospital/77hc-ibv8) (43 MB) - includes scoring of healthcare associated infection developed by Centers of Disease Control and prevention of U.S. hospitals.
4. [Hospital General Information](https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-General-Information/xubh-q36u) (1.9MB) - includes all the registered hospitals' general information.


The following datasets are provided by Kaggle and Yelp respectively.

1. [Hotel Reviews (120MB)](http://kaggle.com/datafiniti/hotel-reviews?select=Datafiniti_Hotel_Reviews_Jun19.csv) - includes a list of 1,000 U.S. hotels and their reviews (near 10K).


## Data problems to be addressed
Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation and exploration are expected to benefit from using Spark.

1. Data cleaning - perform entity resolution of hospitals across datasets.
2. Data transformation - load normalized data into MySQL and Firebase.
3. Data integration - integrate data from different data sources.
4. Data aggregation and exploration - pre-calculation of aggregations will allow for faster querying
for users.

## Databases to be used and how to use them
1. MySQL - Relational database
	* Processed and cleaned hospital data will be stored in MySQL. 
2. Firebase - Non-relational database
	* Processed and cleaned hotel and Yelp data will be stored in NoSQL.
	* multiple datasets with different indexing will be available for faster retrieval.
